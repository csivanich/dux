###### A Tmux wrapper to pool sessions

------

Dux is a python script to allow pooling of Tmux sessions.

**Dux is currently a proof-of-concept**, but already can:
 - Create new sessions with generated names
 - Attach to unattached sessions

This is just a start, **Dux will eventually include**:
 - Rule-based session auto-attaching
 - Better Tmux interaction (tmuxp)
 - Pool groups?
